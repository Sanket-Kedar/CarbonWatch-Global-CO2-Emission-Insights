<h1>CarbonWatch- Global CO2 Emission Insights</h1>
<h2>Objectives</h2>	
The primary goal of the CarbonWatch - Global CO2 Emission Insights Power BI Dashboard is to provide a visually-driven, accurate, and data-driven understanding of worldwide CO2 emissions. The dashboard will provide comprehensive insights into both historical and current CO2 emissions data by utilizing Power BI's data transformation capabilities, calculated columns, and DAX measurements. 

The dashboard will serve as a dynamic tool to:

1)	Interactive charts and maps should be used to visualize the current state of CO2 emissions worldwide.
   
2)	End Users may gain insight into specific industry sectors by identifying the main industries and sources of CO2 emissions.
   
3)	To analyze global progress toward CO2 emission minimizing goals, measuring commitment to international agreements such as the Paris Accord and visualizing trends over time.
   
4)	To support customers in migrating to more earth-friendly solutions by offering useful information and recommending low-carbon activities.
   
5)	Offer easily accessible, latest information that can help businesses, environmental advocates, policymakers, and the public make decisions about minimizing the impacts of climate change.
